# License activation

Once you purchased a license on the [website](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xo-home) you will need to activate it for your appliance.

The procedure is very simple:

1. Log to your Xen Orchestra appliance and go in the Licenses section

2. All the licenses you paid for should be visible on this page. Unbinded licenses should have a green activate license button.
